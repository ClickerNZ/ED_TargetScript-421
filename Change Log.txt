		- Move several Global variables into Local context. (SysCmd, SliderCurve)
		- Remove no longer used Globals (SRVBeam, JSProfile)
		- Rename fnDebugStates() to fnDebug(). This function now only sets Debug and ShowFlags flags
		- MapKeys for EFLNORM and EFRNORM better aligned and improved for Debug functions
		- Remove several 'if (Debug) {}' code blocks

		- requires external script/program to send key values to TARGET dynamically as they change 
		
	Create new point release
	New:
		Attach TCPCallback procedure to TCP port 1000 in ED_Main - Flags key value from status.json
		Modify external CPP program (ED_TCPCallback) to increase buffer size
		Modify external CPP program (ED_TCPCallback) to only send updates when 'Flags' key value changes
		Refactor fnProcessFlags(); and update all script files where used
		Remove fnWaitstart() and create fnGameStarted();
		Fix LED behavior due to above changes
		Detect Supercruise toggle
		-	call fnSetSliderCurve()
		-	if we didn't select drop, sound a warning
		-	if fDanger, select Combat HUD, deploy hardpoints, sound a warning

		Create fnNotValid(fnName) function to announce when a function is not available at this time (eg Landing Gear when in Supercruise)
		-	Reqs fnName string to be set and parsed when calling
		-	Uses fnTextToSpeech()
		Create initTextToSpeech() to detect existence of voice.exe 
		Added more voice feedback when engaging supercruise and for landing gear
		Create fnVoiceVolume() to enable volume control for fnTextToSpeech() via Shift=U on FLAPU or FLAPD on throttle
		Create fnSoundFX() to enable sound effects via a command line .wav file player
		
	Maintenance, Updates & fixes:
		Modify Voice path to include switch usage (use alt voice as example)
		Add space {" ") when building SysCmd in fnTextToSpeech() between path and text 
		Alter timings in mEnterHanger and mLaunch macros
		Change ED_TCPCallback console output. Print time + Flags value instead of entire status.json
		ED_TCPCallback amended to send Flags=0 and...
		Modify fnsProcessFlags() to detect when game stops
		Rewrite fnModeSwitch() to monitor GUIMode for game reload
		Remove Voice Attack integration (use voice.exe via fnTextToSpeech(VoiceTxt))
		Fix Status LEDs becoming misalligned via toggle tracking when we call fnsProcessFlags()
		Fix typo in argumnet in fnTextToSpeech() call for unitiated drop detection code
		Include argument for fnSetLEDs(int x) so we can DeferCall it (future functionality??)
		Minor typo fixes and consistency changes
		Move user configurable settings into ED_UserSettings.tmh file
		Complete rewrite of fnsGetStatusFileInfo() and fnsGetKeyValue()
		Increase buffer for fnTextToSpeech() 'syscmd' to 256

v4.0.1 - mostly maintenance build 
	Fix Reverse Thrust Toggle code
	Fix Mode switch macros due to ARX menu choice addition
	Do not toggle ConnectionStatus after a mode switch

	Tweak mLaunch macro to only rise for 1.5 and don't set throttle to 25%
	Refactor fnGetFlightMode()
	Create check for Voice attack running in launcher script
	Create HCSTriggers flag. Send trigger only when enabled (if HCS/Voiceattack is not running sends LSHIFT+1 as "1" which then opens NAV panel etc)
	Add file read operation to check if VA running and set HCSTriggers flag (fnWaitstart() in EDStateTracker.tmh)
	Refactor all "fp = fopen();" instances to followup with an "if (fp) {}" test wrapper

	Rename files with "ED_" prefix
	Tidy up. Remove old comments and commented code
	Change "ShowConnectionStatus" to SC Press (Up)
	Map "System Map" toggle to SC Press (Down)
	Comment unused key defines in "ED_KeyMap" file
	Add voice.exe functionality to send text to voice messages
	Change Vertical Thrust button for SRV to Slew UP in Control bindings (in game)
	Create fnTextToSpeech() to dynamically build and send system() commands for voice.exe

	Create fnHangerServices(). Mapped to IDLELON/OFF. 
		- Enters Hanger and Station Services + buys fuel, repairs, restock
		- Exit Hanger and Launch ship (rise 3.5 seconds, retract gear, quarter impulse)
			(issue with rise for 3.5 seconds is different ships have different thrust-up rates)
			(issue if lifting off from front pads if height isn't achieved)

	Fix slider curve change not updating in game until move slider by force re-read and resend slider position
	Adjust timing for slider curve change when entering and exiting FSD
	Include command line switch in script launcher to set timeout value to 5 minutes (from 1 minute)

		- move associated Global variables from EDGlobalVars into EDStateTracker
	Tweak CMS (H4U/D/L/R) MapKeys and add MapKeyRUMD for H4L to release ECM
	Create Voice Attack triggers for PIPMode and Curves
		- issue = if VA not running, ED interprets CTRL or SHIFT+num as num
