	Create new point release
	New:
		Attach TCPCallback procedure to TCP port 1000 in ED_Main - Flags key value from status.json
		Modify external CPP program (ED_TCPCallback) to increase buffer size
		Modify external CPP program (ED_TCPCallback) to only send updates when 'Flags' key value changes
		Refactor fnProcessFlags(); and update all script files where used
		Remove fnWaitstart() and create fnGameStarted();
		Fix LED behavior due to above changes
		Detect Supercruise toggle
		-	call fnSetSliderCurve()
		-	if we didn't select drop, sound a warning
		-	if fDanger, select Combat HUD, deploy hardpoints, sound a warning
		Add voice response to tgPlanetView()
		Add keybinds for Pitch and Yaw and include defines for same (for future AutoPilot implementation)
		Create "uninitiated drop detected" code
		-	Includes tracking when we enter and exit OrbitalCruise
		Create fnNotValid(fnName) function to announce when a function is not available at this time (eg Landing Gear when in Supercruise)
		-	Reqs fnName string to be set and parsed when calling
		-	Uses fnTextToSpeech()
		Create initTextToSpeech() to detect existence of voice.exe

		Modify fnsProcessFlags() to detect when game stops
		Rewrite fnModeSwitch() to monitor GUIMode for game reload
		Remove Voice Attack integration (use voice.exe via fnTextToSpeech(VoiceTxt))
		Fix Status LEDs becoming misalligned via toggle tracking when we call fnsProcessFlags()
		Fix typo in argumnet in fnTextToSpeech() call for unitiated drop detection code
		Include argument for fnSetLEDs(int x) so we can DeferCall it (future functionality??)

v4.0.1 - mostly maintenance build 
	Fix Reverse Thrust Toggle code

	Change "ShowConnectionStatus" to SC Press (Up)
	Map "System Map" toggle to SC Press (Down)

	Create fnHangerServices(). Mapped to IDLELON/OFF. 
		- Enters Hanger and Station Services + buys fuel, repairs, restock
		- Exit Hanger and Launch ship (rise 3.5 seconds, retract gear, quarter impulse)
